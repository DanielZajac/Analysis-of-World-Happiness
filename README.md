# Analysis of World Happiness

##### *Daniel Zajac*

It has been said that happiness comes from within, implying that regardless of someone's situation and surroundings, they can live a happy life. After finding a dataset with 'happiness scores' from different countires around the world, I wanted to evaulate the effects that a person's environment has on their happiness and their quality of life. Many countries around the world are vastly different; some have free health care and a world-class education system, while others don't have easy access to fresh water. Some countries have advanced medical technology, while others are unable to cure common diseases. Another commonly used phrase is that money cannot buy happiness, and yet most people in the world would say that they would be happier with more money. With all being said, it seems likely that variables such as healthy life expectancy, gross domestic product per capita (GDP) and political corruption would have an impact on people's well being, so using data collected globally from 2006-2019, I will explore the relationship between these variables and happiness score in several countries.
